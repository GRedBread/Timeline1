            <p id="description">Bloons Tower Defense (BTD) is a highly popular tower defense game series where players fend off waves of attacking bloons (balloons) by strategically positioning various types of towers along a path. Each tower offers unique abilities, costs, and upgrade paths, designed to pop bloons within their range. The ultimate objective is to stop the bloons from reaching the end of the track.</p>
